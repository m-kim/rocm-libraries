"""LDS bank-conflict swizzle for TLU=1 (NT) subtile transpose reads.

The NT path writes each operand free-dim contiguous, K-major, into LDS: chunk
index ``c`` (one 128-bit / mStripBytes block) holds logical K-row ``c``.  The
``ds_read_b64_tr_b4`` transpose read then addresses those chunks by K.  In the
baseline (no swizzle) layout the 32 lanes of a read half map onto only 32 of
the 64 banks in a repeating pattern, producing a 2-way bank conflict (verified
in ``format.md`` and reproduced by the standalone bank model).

A per-chunk XOR permutation plus a byte pad inserted between load-blocks moves
the colliding chunks onto distinct banks, recovering a 1-way (conflict-free)
access.  The XOR is an involution, so the *same* transform is applied on the GR
write side (which global K-row each lane fetches) and the LR read side (which
chunk each lane addresses); the LDS image round-trips A exactly.

The transform is selected by the stack size ``subtileShape[0]`` (number of MMA
tiles stacked along the free dim): 2x1 and 4x1 use the XOR above, 8x1 and 16x1
use the column-scatter layout instead (see ``TLUColScatter``), and any stack
whose rules are not validated falls back to no swizzle (``None``).

    load ``k % N`` (N = stackM), and its ``col_group = k // N`` is placed at a

    THE single gate for that swizzle.  Both SubtileGREmit and SubtileLREmit must
    call this and nothing else: the XOR is an involution, so GR permuting which
    global rows a lane fetches and LR un-permuting on read compose to the
    identity ONLY if both sides agree.  A one-sided swizzle assembles, runs, and
    silently returns wrong A -- there is no assert that can catch it downstream,
    which is why the decision lives in one function rather than in two matching
    conditions.

    Everything else in this module is fp4 chunk algebra and does not describe a
    bf16 tile; this sits here to keep the TLU=1 swizzle decisions in one place.

    Deliberately NOT gated on _sharedStrip, unlike the fp4 selectTLUSwizzle.
    That gate exists because a cooperating wave fetches only a K slice, so its
    chunk ramp yields k relative to the slice while the LR read reconstructs k
    absolute.  The bf16 GR emit closes that gap directly: it sources the high k
    bits from the fetch-group index (see _emitTLU1GRSwizzleB16), so k is
    absolute for every wave and the involution holds.  Restoring the gate here
    would cost the swizzle at every shape except MacroTile >= 256 with
    MIWaveGroup [4, 1] -- one configuration out of nine -- and would leave
    MT 64x64, where the LDS pressure is highest, unswizzled.

    Both halves of that are measured, not argued.  Correctness: eight of the nine
    shapes (every gated one) run bit-exact against an absolute MFMA reference in
    test_gr_lr_roundtrip_b16_tlu1.py, swizzle on and off; the ninth, MT 256
    WG[1,4], exceeds the harness VGPR budget and is covered off-device instead.
    Value: on gfx950, SQ_LDS_BANK_CONFLICT over a 2048^3 bf16 NN run falls from
    12,648,448 to 65,536 at MT 64x64 WG[1,4] (whole strip) and from 6,356,992 to
    65,536 at WG[2,2] (shared strip) -- so a gated shape reaches the same
