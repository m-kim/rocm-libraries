"""The 16-bit ds-immediate bound on the swizzled non-TLU=1 subtile LR path.

emitSingleDsRead addresses every local read off one per-lane base register plus
a ds immediate, with no staging register to hold a 64 KB-aligned top (the TLU=1
bf16 path has one -- sharedVgprLRBigOffset).  Past the 16-bit field the operand
cannot be addressed at all and the assembler rejects the kernel with "expected a
16-bit unsigned offset", so _subtileLRDsImmediateReason has to reject the
solution first.

The expectations below are the offsets actually emitted for the B operand of an
NN bf16 subtile kernel at DepthU 128, MIWaveGroup [2,2], captured from
Tensile/Components/Subtile/SubtileLREmit.py.
