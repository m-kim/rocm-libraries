"""Subtile geometry validation for ``UseSubtileImpl`` solutions.

Lives under ``Tensile/SolutionStructs/Validators/`` alongside the other
Solution-level validators, so the subtile layout rules are not interleaved with
the rest of Solution.py.

These decide whether a wave group can lay out a subtile: how tall an LDS strip
may be, whether waves share one, and whether the global-read K partition hits a
known bug. They answer in rejection-reason strings -- ``None`` means the
geometry is fine -- because the same predicates drive the stack-height backoff
ladder and produce the message the caller rejects with.

Public entry points: :func:`subtileStackForTLU1`, :func:`subtileStackForB16TLU1`,
:func:`subtileTLU1StackReason`, :func:`validateSubtileGRKPartition` and the
bf16 stack ladder ``SUBTILE_STACK_SIZES_B16``.
